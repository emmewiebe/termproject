Description:
This project is a React app that uses a dog-themed API to display information about different dogs. It lets users view details for each dog and add them to a favorites list. it also displays 10 random dogs everytime you refresh. 

How to run: 
cd to dog-app 
npm install 
npm run dev 

Challenges I Faced:

One challenge was figuring out how to work with the IDs from the API. At first, I thought I could just make up my own IDs, like in a class lecture where the Studio Ghibli movies had custom ones, but I realized each API has its own unique IDs already built in. I had to go back, check the API documentation, and use the correct IDs for my project. It was a good lesson in paying attention to how APIs work! Other than that, organizing the components and making everything look good in the app was a fun challenge that helped me get more comfortable with React.
